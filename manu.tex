% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{algorithm}

% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize, captions=false]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

\usepackage{epsfig}
\usepackage{graphicx}
%\usepackage{subfloat}
%\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{mwe}
\usepackage{subfig}

\usepackage{algcompatible}

%\usepackage{algpseudocode}
%\usepackage{algpseudocode}

%\usepackage[section]{placeins}

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

%Content distribution network (CDN) is widely used to efficiently deliver streaming media. 
%The CDN with dedicated network bandwidths and hardware supports can provide high-quality streaming services but at a high cost. 
%On the other side, the rise of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are scalable but do not guarantee high quality streaming service due to the transient nature of peers.
In this paper, we present peer-assisted CDN model, the peer-to-peer networks that can be used to help CDN to deliver streaming media.
Our peer-assisted CDN model is aided by Youtube VoD views popularity model called CPPro.
We have comparatively evaluated CPPro through trace-driven simulations with synthetic workloads.
We use three scenarios in our simulation which are 
(a) the video popularity in the CPPro system follows the global popularity of the video.
(b) the video popularity in the CPPro system is lagged behind the global popularity by several weeks.
(c) the video popularity in the CPPro is unrelated to the global popularity.
Our results show that CPPro gives lower number of replicas while maintaining same number of peers contribution compare to counterpart work. 
We also do the significance to the number of replicas using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on two samples and we find our results are significant.% ($p-values < 0.1$).

\section{Introduction}
Streaming contents, especially video, represents a significant fraction of the traffic volume on the Internet, and it has become a standard practice to deliver this type of content using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) such as Akamai and Limelight for better scaling and quality of experience for the end users. 
For example, Youtube uses Google cache and MTV uses Akamai in their operations.

With the spread of broadband Internet access at a reasonable flat monthly rate, users are connected to the Internet 24 hours a day and they can download and share multimedia content. P2P (peer to peer) applications are also widely deployed. 
In China, P2P is very popular; we see many P2P applications from China such as PPLive, PPStream, UUSe, Xunlei, etc. \cite{Vu:2010:UOC:1865106.1865115}. 
Some news broadcasters also rely on P2P technology to deliver popular live events. 
For example, CNN uses the Octoshape \cite{octoshape} solution that enables their broadcast to scale and offer good video quality as the number of users increases.

From the Internet provider point of view, the presence of so many always-on users suggests that it is possible to delegate a portion of computing, storage and networking tasks to the users, thus creating P2P networks where users can share files and multimedia content. 
Starting from file sharing protocols, P2P architectures have evolved toward video on demand and support for live events.

%A P2P based architecture usually requires a sufficient number of nodes supplying the data (seeders) to start the distribution process among the joining peers.  
%A peer usually offers a low outbound streaming rate due to the traditional asymmetrical DSL home connectivity and hence multiple peers must jointly stream contents to a requesting peer (leecher).  
%The decentralized, uncoordinated operation implies that scaling to a high number of peers comes with side effects.  
%Typical problems of a P2P streaming architecture are low stream quality with undesirable disruptions, resource unfairness due to heterogeneous peer resources, and high startup delay.  
%Moreover, current P2P applications are not aware of the underlying network and may conflict with the ISP routing policies and business model.

%A number of P2P streaming applications have been designed, analyzed and deployed, attracting a significant number of users.  
%Research studies and deployment experiences have both demonstrated that P2P is a promising solution in terms of scalability and deployment costs.  
%On the other hand, the heterogeneous nature and unstable behavior of the peers contributing bandwidth and computational resources, along with the networking issues, affect the user experience and limit the commercial success of P2P video streaming applications.
Alternatively, video contents can be efficiently distributed on services offered by managed network architectures and CDN companies.
The major issues of CDN are high deployment cost and good but not unlimited scalability in the long term.  
Given the complementary features of P2P and CDN, in recent years some hybrid solutions have been proposed and applied to  operational  CDN \cite{Huang:2008:UHC:1496046.1496064,4772628,Yin:2009:DDH:1631272.1631279} to take the best of both approaches.
In Peer assisted CDN, users can download content from CDN nodes from or other users or peers. 
A user may cache the content after download to serve requests from other users. 
Due to the complexity of the behavior of peers, the processing should be done in the home gateway user where the ISP can control it.

In this work, we will revisit Guo et al.'s PROP, \cite{1613869} as a basis to evaluate peer-assisted CDN and propose an improvement to the model for the PROP called CPPro (this system is called CPPro abbreviated from our technical term "CDN-P2P Project").
In PROP's utility function, the difference between very popular videos and unpopular video is very difficult to differentiate. 
For an unpopular video, $f(p)$ will be very close to $f(p_{min})$ thus $f(p) - f(p_{min})$ will be very close to $0$ then the utility function becomes very small.
For a very popular video, $f(p)$ will be very close to $f(p_{max})$, thus $f(p_{max}) - f(p)$ will be very close to $0$ and the  utility function becomes very small.  
We will take Youtube as an example of an Internet VoD service model.
In the Youtube service model, we can get data such as (1) the time when a video is uploaded and (2) the number of accesses or number of views.
We can get such data using Youtube's API.
%In seminal work,
Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} used the above information to estimate when a video will become very popular.
They divided a video's popularity into three phases: before-peak phase, at-peak phase, and after-peak phase.
We will use an estimate of a video's popularity phases for helping PROP.
We will explain video popularity in Sec.\ref{popularity}.
Our contribution is as follows:
(1) We use the idea of VoD view popularity model to aid the PROP. 
To the best of our knowledge, the combination of the PROP and the VoD view popularity model is new.
(2) From simulation-based experiments, we find that peer contributions in CPPro are almost as good as  PROP while the numbers of replicas are lower, achieving the same performance with fewer resources.

Our paper presentation as follows: (1) we describe related work in sect.\ref{relatedwork}; (2) we explain detail of Youtube popularity evolution model in sect.\ref{popularity}; (3) we explain the caching strategy for CDN and peer in sect.\ref{systemdescription}; (4) we explain our simulation design, simulator, and its evaluation in sect.\ref{evaluation}.
Finally, we present our conclusions in section \ref{conclusion}.

\section{Related Work}\label{relatedwork}
Content Distribution Networks with peer assist have been successfully deployed on the Internet, such as Akamai \cite{Zhao:2013:PCD:2504730.2504752}, \cite{Huang:2008:UHC:1496046.1496064} and LiveSky \cite{Yin:2010:LEC:1823746.1823750}.  
The authors of \cite{Zhao:2013:PCD:2504730.2504752} examine the risks and benefits of peer-assisted content distribution in Akamai and measure the effectiveness of its peer-assisted approach. 
The authors of \cite{Huang:2008:UHC:1496046.1496064} conclude from two real world traces that hybrid CDN-P2P can significantly reduce the cost of content distribution and can scale to cope with the exponential growth of Internet video content.  
Yin et al. \cite{Yin:2010:LEC:1823746.1823750} described commercial operation of a peer-assisted CDN in China.  
LiveSky solved several challenges in the system design, such as dynamic resource scaling of P2P, low startup latency, ease of P2P integration with the existing CDN infrastructure, and network friendliness and upload fairness in the P2P operation.  
Xu et al.\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-4915} used game-theory to show the right cooperative profit distribution of P2P can help the ISP to maximize the utility.  
Their model can easily be implemented in the context of current Internet economic settlements.  
Misra et al.\cite{Misra:2010:IPS:1811099.1811064} also mentioned the importance of P2P architecture to support content delivery networks.
The authors use cooperative game theory to formulate simple compensation rules for users who run P2P to support content delivery networks.

The idea of telco- or ISP-managed CDN has been proposed in recent years.  
The complexity of the CDN business encourages telcos and ISPs to manage their own CDN, rather than allow others to run CDNs on their networks.  
It has been shown that it is cost effective \cite{federation}\cite{norton2011internet}. 
Kamiyama et al. \cite{NoriakiKAMIYAMA2013} proposed optimally ISP operated CDN.
Kamiyama et al. mentioned that, in order to deliver large and rich Internet content to users, ISPs need to put their CDNs in data centers.  
The locations are limited while the storage is large, making this solution effective; using optimum placement algorithm based on real ISP network topologies.  
The authors found that inserting a CDN into an ISP's ladder-type network is effective in reducing the hop count, thus reduce total link cost.  
Based on the author definition: Ladder-type network is a network with a maximum degree under $10$.
Cisco has initiated an effort to connect telco- or ISP-managed CDNs to each other, to form a CDN federation \cite{federation} using open standards \cite{cdni}.  
They argue that the current CDN architecture is not close enough to the users and ISPs can fill this position.

The idea of utilizing the user's computation power to support ISP operation is not new.  
The Figaro project \cite{figaro} proposed the residential gateway as an integrator of different networks and services, becoming an Internet-wide distributed content management for a proposed future Internet architecture \cite{figaro}.  
Cha et al.,\cite{Cha:2008:NTP:1855641.1855646} performed trace analysis and found that an IPTV architecture powered by P2P can handle a much larger number of channels, with lower demand for infrastructure compared to IP multicast.  
Jiang et al. \cite{Jiang:2012:OMD:2413176.2413193} proposed scalable and adaptive content replication and request routing for CDN servers located in users' home gateways.  
Maki et al.,\cite{NaoyaMAKI2012} propose traffic engineering for peer-assisted CDN to control the behavior of clients, and present a solution for optimizing the selection of content files.
Mathieu et al., \cite{6249305} are using data gathered from France telecom network to calculate reduction of network load if customers are employed as peer-assisted content delivery.

Guo et al., \cite{1613869} work's PROP is closest with our work.
%because we use that work as comparison and we use author's utility function.
PROP uses local system (local counter) to calculate the segment popularity in peer-assisted proxy system. 
PROP uses popularity for proxy cache replacement strategy. 
In peer side, the author use utility function for cache replacement strategy.
A utility function assigns numerical value to outcomes, in such a way that outcomes with higher utility are always preferred of outcomes with lower utilities.
In PROP's utility function, the difference between very popular videos and unpopular video is very difficult to differentiate. 
The utility function is also function from popularity.
While the authors successfully show that the results are very good, the peer-assisted system behavior over time is not explain because the author focus on properties such as proxy cache size variations and peer cache size variations.
The explanation of the optimal number of replicas is not also clear because unavailable information when the snapshot is taken.  
In our work, we complement Guo et al., \cite{1613869} work with VoD viewing popularity evolution model and describe the behavior of the peer-assisted CDN over the time.

\section{Determining Internet VoD Popularity Phase}\label{popularity}

The objective of determining the Internet VoD popularity phase is to determine whether a video is at before-peak, at-peak, or after-peak phase, to be used by peers in their caching strategy.
For this purpose we use the Youtube content popularity dataset from Borghol et. al.,\cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717}  which contains data about 29791 videos, including the view count and upload time, during 36 weeks of measurements.
Figure~\ref{fig:timetopeak} is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the time-to-peak distribution from Borghol et. al.,\cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717}  which shows that around three-quarters of the videos peak within the first six weeks after upload.
The time-to-peak is exponentially distributed up to the sixth week, and it is uniform beyond the sixth week.
Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} define time-to-peak for a video as its age (time since upload) at which its weekly viewing rate is the highest during measurement (from the first week until end of measurement).
Because we know the peak time (at-peak phase) of every video, we can also find the before-peak phase and after-phase of every video. 
Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} mentioned that view count evolution follows beta distribution.
For detail we refer the readers to \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717}.

Our algorithm for determining a requested video is quite simple.  
As we know the age of a requested video in week number and its view rate, the algorithms looks for Borghol dataset with the same week, one week before, and one week after for the same view rate.  
We are averaging the relative week to at-peak values in the same week, one week before, and one week after. 

Suppose a video $v$ in the Borghol dataset has a viewing rate $r_v(t)$, $0 <= t < t_f$, and $r_v(t)$ peaks at $t_{vp}$.
%The data is transformed by including the relative time-to-peak, such that each data point is a 2-tuple: video rate and relative time to peak:, i.e., $rp_v(t) =$ < $r_v(t), t_p(t)$ >, $t_p(t) = t - t_{vp}$.
The data is transformed by including the relative time-to-peak, such that each data point is a 2-tuple: video rate and relative time to peak:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rp}
r_p^v(t) = \langle r_v(t), t_p(t) \rangle
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tp}
t_p(t) = t - t_{vp}.
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:viewratedistribution} shows the Borghol's dataset with time axis for each video is translated by $t_{vp}$ to the left, such that each video peaks at time $0$.

In determining the phase of a requested video $e$ with known age $t_e$ and view rate $r_e$ at $t_e$, we find the three $r_v$ data points whose rates are closest to $r_e$ at $t_e$, $(t_e - 1)$, and $(t_e + 1)$ for all videos from Borghol dataset, and then average the $t_p$ of the three data points.
The phase of the requested video $e$ is estimated to be before-peak, at-peak, or after-peak based on whether the average is negative, $0$, or positive.
The view rate $r_e$ of a video is calculated by subtracting the view counts at the time of the current and the previous video requests.
The pseudo code for averaging the $t_p$ is shown in algorithm \ref{alg2}.
%The view rate $r_e$  of a video is calculated using the view counts at the time of the current and the previous video requests.

But when a video is being requested for the first time, the phase can only be estimated using the age of the video.
In this case, we draw 36 weighted random integer numbers $s_i$, $0 <= i <= 35$ where the weighted factor is from time-to-peak phase CDF as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:timetopeak} then calculate the count of each integers between $0$ and $t_e$ from the drawn numbers then divide the result by 36, 
%i.e., $estphase = \sum$ of $0 <= i <= t_e$ , $count(i, s)/36$.
i.e., $estphase = \sum_{0}^{t_e} \frac{count(i,s)}{36}$.
The number 36 come from the duration of measurement and each week has its own probability as we shown in fig.~\ref{fig:timetopeak}.
%This result represents the estimated phase, where $estphase \leq 0.5$ the phase is before-peak; if $0.5 < estphase \leq 0.75$ the phase is at peak, and $estphase > 0.75$ is after-peak.
%From fig.~\ref{fig:timetopeak} since from first week until sixth week the time 
This result represents the estimated phase. 
From time to peak distribution, $50\%$ of video reach peak within four weeks. 
At that level, we expect that half of videos may reach at-peak and half of videos are not yet reach at-peak.
Therefore we put $0.5$ as low threshold.  
Still from the same time to peak distribution $75\%$ of video reach peak within six weeks, and beyond six week the distribution is considered, it means there are not much additional view count. 
In other words, beyond six weeks we consider videos reach after-peak phase. 
Therefore we put $0.75$ as high threshold.
The pseudo code for this purpose is shown in algorithm \ref{alg3}.

}
\label{fig:p2pcdninteractioninsimulator}
\end{figure} 



\section{System Description}\label{systemdescription}

\subsection{System Overview}\label{systemoverview}
The main components of the system are: (1) a CDN and (2) a set of peers which are self organized into a P2P overlay network.
Each peer in the system has two functions.
First, a peer is a client that requests a video. 
Second, a peer is a contributor that shares the cached video with other peers in the system. 
Peers control the number and utilization of their connection based on current resources availability.
In fig.\ref{fig:p2pcdninteractioninsimulator}, we describe the process of a peer that requests a video which derived from PROP.
When a video is requested for the first time, the CDN is responsible for delivering the requested video.
When a CDN receives a query for the same video, a CDN will find suitable peers that currently have a copy of the requested video.
The CDN then returns information about these peers to the querying peer.



\subsection{Peer caching strategy}\label{peercachingstrategy}

A peer stores the requested videos into its cache based on the value of a utility function, i.e., in a peer with a full cache a newly requested video will replace one or more videos in the cache whose utility values are smaller than that of the new video.
The utility function reflects the popularity of a video in the system that considering number of copy of its video or replica. 
PROP's $u$ value itself lies in interval $[0,2]$ Guo et al.,\cite{1613869}.
Our utility function $u$ is:
\begin{equation}
u = \frac{ (f(p) - f(p_{min})) (f(p_{max}) - f(p)) }{r^{\alpha + \beta}} + z(t)
\end{equation}

where the first term is the utility function of PROP, and the second term, $z(t)$, is the phase factor that we introduced in CPPro, where $z(t)$ is large if the video phase is at-peak.
$p$, $p_{min}$, and $p_{max}$ are the popularity of the video, the minimum popularity, and the maximum popularity in the system.
We follow \cite{1613869} for $f(p) = log(p)$.
The popularity of a video is the determined by the view rate of the video.
$r$ is the number of replicas. 
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are adjustment factor \cite{1613869}.

Following \cite{1613869}, we can calculate $p$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
p = min \left(\frac{n_i^r}{t_i^r - t_a^i}  , \frac{1}{t_{cur} - t_i^r}\right)
\end{equation}
Where $n_i^r$ is number of requested video, $t_i^r$ is last time the video is requested, $t_a^i$ is the time when the video is accessed for the first time, and $t_{cur}$ is the current time.
To able to track the simulation, we use default value from PROP thus we refer the readers to \cite{1613869} for the details.

The $z(t)$ values are set as follows:
\begin{equation}
 z(t) = 
  \begin{cases}
   0.15 & \text{if phase estimation is before-peak} \\
   0.47 & \text{if phase estimation is at-peak} \\
   0.38 & \text{if phase estimation is after-peak}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}\label{eq:zfactor}

where the numbers are based on the proportion of video counts in the Youtube dataset before the peaks, around the peaks, and after the peaks. 
$z(t)$ for at-peak is determined by the total proportion of video counts from 1-week-before until 1-week-after the peak, which accounts to almost half of the total.
The value of $z(t)$ is assigned after we finish to determine a video popularity phase.  
For example: if we determine a video popularity phase is at-peak, then we assign $z(t)=0.47$.

\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}

We performed simulations to compare the performance of CPPro against PROP in two main metrics: (1) peer contributions in video delivery, and (2) number of video replicas in peers.
The peer contribution is the number of videos served by a peer instead of by the CDN server.
The number of video replicas shows how much storage is used in peers to contribute in video delivery.
The peer contribution metric is related to the byte-hit-ratio. 
The byte-hit-ratio is defined as the total bytes of content served by peers normalized by the total bytes of video all peers and the CDN consume.
With more peer contributions, we will have higher byte-hit-ratio because peer can get content from other peers. 
However, because we only interested in peer performance, we compare peer contribution between PROP and CPPro.
Contribution ratio of peer to total contribution (comparing to CDN contribution) becomes irrelevant in this case.

\subsection{Simulation Design}\label{simulationdesign}

This peer-assisted CDN is simulated using an event driven simulation implemented in Python. 
Peers request videos from a video catalog where the peer request as well as the videos in the catalog are generated using certain distributions.


\subsubsection{Video Catalog}\label{catalog}
Each video in the catalog has the following properties: 
video-id,size,upload time, final view count, view count function parameters. 
View count parameters are the distribution parameters.
The final view count is the total number of views of a video at the end of simulation and it is generated using uniform distribution sampling from Borghol dataset ranging from 27 until 1069385.
The upload time interval is a Poisson process with $\lambda=1$.
The video size is generated using a uniform distribution.
Because of the very weak relationship between video size and popularity \cite{abhari2010workload} and because our work focuses on the impact of the popularity aspect on the utility function rather than storage optimization we believe that the choice to assign a random uniform video size from the Youtube dataset does not have an effect to our results. 
The view rate progression from the upload time until the end of simulation time is modeled using a Beta distribution \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717}.
As Borghol et al.,\cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} showed that view rate of a video can be modeled using beta distribution we can calculate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters.
We can use Beta distribution mode formula $m=\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+\beta-2}$ to calculate $\alpha$ or $\beta$. 
In this case, we choose $\alpha$ random uniform between $1$ and $3$ and $m$ is view rate at-peak, thus we can get $\beta=\frac{\alpha-1}{m}-\alpha-2$.
%The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters are uniformly distributed. 


\subsubsection{Peer Request Generator}\label{peerrequest}
Peers request videos from the catalog using a Poisson process with $\lambda=1$ \cite{Zink:2009:CYN:1502814.1502987} for the inter-arrival time.
For the requested videos there are three scenarios A,B,and C.
In Scenario A, the video popularity in the peer-assisted CDN system follows the global popularity of the video.
In Scenario B, the video popularity in the peer-assisted CDN system lags four weeks behind the global popularity of the video. 
We choose four weeks lags based on the probability from time-to-peak distribution that half of videos are already reach peak within four weeks.
In Scenario C, the video popularity in the peer-assisted CDN system does not follow the global popularity of the video. 
We use a Zipf distribution with rate$=0.9$ for this purpose \cite{6654887}.




\subsubsection{Simulation Parameters}
We have four variations of parameter (from A to D) used in simulation as shown in table \ref{tab:parameters}.
\begin{table}[!t]
\caption{Parameters variations}
\label{tab:parameters}
\centering

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
 & Number of requests & Number of videos \\ \hline
A & 5001101 & 5000 \\ \hline 
B & 5001101 & 10000 \\ \hline 
C & 5001101 & 15000 \\ \hline 
D & 15000617 & 5000 \\ \hline 
E & 15000617 & 10000 \\ \hline 
F & 15000617 & 15000 \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


We also have several fixed value for other parameters as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Length: $360$ days.
\item Video size: uniform random between $1$MB and $200$MB.
\item Peer storage capacity: $500$MB.
\item CDN storage capacity: $10000$MB.
\item Number of peers: $10000$.
\item Peer's caching strategy: CPPro, PROP.
\end{itemize}
Finally, we compare our results to PROP \cite{1613869} implementation.

\subsection{Result and Discussion}\label{resultanddiscussion}

Figure~\ref{fig:peercontribution} shows the peer contributions in each scenario ranked by the number of videos served by each peer for parameter A, B, C, and D.
They exhibit a similar pattern and only differ in the tails for all scenarios, where CPPro gives higher, albeit insignificant, results.
The difference between CPPro and PROP for parameter A,B,C,and D are shown in fig.\ref{fig:peerdiff}.

These results show that the introduction of $z(t)$ component to the utility function does not affect the performance in terms of peer contributions.
The advantage of CPPro to PROP is evident in fig.~\ref{fig:replica} which shows the number of replicas of the requested videos at each request event.
The difference numbers of replicas for scenario A,B, and C for each parameters are shown in fig \ref{fig:replicadiff}.
Our simulation shows that CPPro gives lower replicas compared to PROP.

When a peer requests a video from another peer, a peer has to decide whether a peer wants to cache the video or not to cache the video based on the calculated utility function value.  
If a peer decided to cache a video, we called it cached event.
If a peer did not decide to cache a video, we called it not-cached event.
We breakdown how many cache events occur in our simulation as shown in fig.\ref{fig:cacheevents}.
Furthermore, we breakdown again by video popularity phase for CPROP's cached and not-cached events as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:cacheeventsphase}.
From fig.\ref{fig:cacheevents}, we can see that CPPro cached less videos compared to PROP for all scenarios.
CPPro cached events are fewer than PROP because in CPPro the probability of cached events are fewer than not-cached events. 
We want to know what makes cached events in CPPro are fewer than PROP.
Assume a peer requests a video with utility function $u_r$ and the minimum utility function inside peer's cache is $u_c$-min. %as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:cached-notcached} where we have five videos inside peer's cache.
Intuitively, when a requested video in after-peak phase and  videos inside peer's storage are in at-peak phase then in CPPro case high probability that a requested video will not be cached.  
In PROP case, since PROP does not has video popularity phase the probability of a requested video will not be cached is lower than CPPro.
We can take same intuition for before-peak and at-peak phase.

% Furthermore, in before-peak phase of CPPro, if a requested video is estimated as before-peak and  videos inside peer's storage may in at-peak or after-peak phase, then the utility function of a requested video value is lower than the utility function of videos inside peer's storage.
% In at-peak phase of CPPro, a requested video is estimated as at-peak phase, while videos inside peer's storage are at-peak phase or after-peak phase. 
% If videos inside peer's storage are at-peak phase, then number of replicas if the only factor that affect utility function.   
% If videos inside peer's storage are after-peak phase and the number of replicas are same, a requested video will be cached since it has higher utility function value.
% In after-peak phase of CPPro, a requested video is estimated as after-peak, while videos inside peer's storage are at-peak phase or after-peak phase.

%In CPPro, The cached events happen more frequently in scenario A comparing to scenario B, because in scenario B when we shift requests four weeks later, estimated of requested videos will probably fall at-peak phase or after-peak phase and the videos in peer's cache are also probably estimated at-peak phase or after-peak thus probability of not-cached events are higher in scenario B than scenario A.
In fig.\ref{fig:cacheeventsphase}, the at-peak phase has low proportion comparing to before-peak and after-peak phase because when we estimate popularity phase of a requested video, the estimate of video to be at-peak phase occurs when average of relative week is exactly $0$. 
In fig.\ref{fig:cacheeventsphase}, the after-peak phase has high proportion comparing to before-peak and after peak phase in scenario A and B because video popularity evolution model that we use to estimate a new requested video assume that after six weeks most of video will enter after peak phase. 
In scenario B, its higher than scenario A since we shifted four weeks. 
In scenario C, while after-peak phase has higher proportion than before-peak and at-peak phase, its proportion is lower than scenario A an B because different popularity video choice.
In fig.\ref{fig:cacheeventsphase}, the before-peak phase in scenario A has higher proportion comparing to scenario B because in scenario B we shift the video request time four weeks thus the probability of a requested video to be before-peak is lower than scenario A. 
In scenario C, the proportion before-peak phase is higher than scenario A and B. 
This is due to different popularity of video choice that a requested video is estimated to be before-peak phase but the video inside peer's cache are having lower utility function.

Figure \ref{fig:cdfutil} shows the CDF of utility function when a peer cached a requested video.
We plot the utility value of a requested video and the minimum utility function of a video in peer's cache.
Although inset graph in fig.~\ref{fig:cdfutil} shows CDF utility value for parameter A. 
It also reflects typical CDF utility value for other parameters. 
It shows that in the head part and the tail part of the distribution, the difference between minimum utility value inside peer's cache and a requested video's utility value are large enough due to additional of $z(t)$ factor. 
This result is good since in the PROP for very popular and not very popular videos the utility values are almost same.
In the body of distribution, we can see the utility values for moderated popular video.
%The CPPro is still can differentiate the utility value between a requested a video and a video inside peer's cache. 



\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{conclusion}
This paper presents a scheme for peer-to-peer network can help CDN to deliver the content over the Internet. 
We show that by introducing $z$ factor to utility function CPPro can maintain same peer contribution while reducing number of replicas.
We found that there are no much different all scenario in term of peer contribution to deliver a video. 
However, we found that in the all scenarios, CPPro gives lower replicas than PROP because in CPPro, we found that probability not-cached events occur are higher than cached events, furthermore compared to PROP, probability a peer is not cache a requested video is higher in CPPro compared to PROP.
Therefore, in CPPro the numbers of available replicas are lower than PROP. 
We also did the significance test to the number of replicas using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on two samples and we find that for all scenarios the $p$-values are less than $1$\% thus the results are significant. 

Some areas of improvement that we have identified for future are: (1) since we know the CPPro can delivery a video similar to PROP with less replica, we are interested to know the energy trade-off of this peer-assisted CDN architecture in order to know how much energy saving by ISP and how much increase of energy at users home gateway side in this architecture since we have higher peer contribution.   
(2) Involving the different popularity model from different geographically VoD service.
This is very important to see the system behavior when receiving request from different location with different popularity while still in the same global CDN service. 
Furthermore, we can exploit this behavior for commercial ads in VoD service.
