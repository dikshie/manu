% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

%
\documentclass[10pt,final,journal,a4paper]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize, captions=false]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

\usepackage{epsfig}
\usepackage{graphicx}
%\usepackage{subfloat}
%\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{mwe}
\usepackage{subfig}
\usepackage{float}
%\usepackage{subfloat}
%\usepackage[section]{placeins}

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

%Content distribution network (CDN) is widely used to efficiently deliver streaming media.

In this paper, we present peer-assisted CDN model, the peer-to-peer networks that can be used to help CDN to deliver streaming media.
Our peer-assisted CDN model is aided by Youtube VoD views popularity model.
We have comparatively evaluated our system through trace-driven simulations with synthetic workloads.
Our results show that our model gives lower number of replicas while maintaining same number of peers contribution compare to previous work. 
We also do the significance to the number of replicas using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on two samples and we find our results are significant.

\section{Introduction}
Streaming content, especially video, represents a significant fraction of the traffic volume on the Internet, and it has become a standard practice to deliver this type of content using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) such as Akamai and Limelight for better scaling and quality of experience for the end users. 
For example, YouTube uses Google cache and MTV uses Akamai in their operations.

With the spread of broadband Internet access at a reasonable flat monthly rate, users are connected to the Internet 24 hours a day and they can download and share multimedia content. P2P (peer to peer) applications are also widely deployed. 
In China, P2P is very popular; we see many P2P applications from China such as PPLive, PPStream, UUSe, Xunlei, etc. \cite{Vu:2010:UOC:1865106.1865115}. 
Some news broadcasters also rely on P2P technology to deliver popular live events. 
For example, CNN uses the Octoshape \cite{octoshape} solution that enables their broadcast to scale and offer good video quality as the number of users increases.

From the Internet provider point of view, the presence of so many always-on users suggests that it is possible to delegate a portion of computing, storage and networking tasks to the users, thus creating P2P networks where users can share files and multimedia content. 
Starting from file sharing protocols, P2P architectures have evolved toward video on demand and support for live events.

%A P2P based architecture usually requires a sufficient number of nodes supplying the data (seeders) to start the distribution process among the joining peers.  
%A peer usually offers a low outbound streaming rate due to the traditional asymmetrical DSL home connectivity and hence multiple peers must jointly stream contents to a requesting peer (leecher).  
%The decentralized, uncoordinated operation implies that scaling to a high number of peers comes with side effects.  
%Typical problems of a P2P streaming architecture are low stream quality with undesirable disruptions, resource unfairness due to heterogeneous peer resources, and high startup delay.  
%Moreover, current P2P applications are not aware of the underlying network and may conflict with the ISP routing policies and business model.

%A number of P2P streaming applications have been designed, analyzed and deployed, attracting a significant number of users.  
%Research studies and deployment experiences have both demonstrated that P2P is a promising solution in terms of scalability and deployment costs.  
%On the other hand, the heterogeneous nature and unstable behavior of the peers contributing bandwidth and computational resources, along with the networking issues, affect the user experience and limit the commercial success of P2P video streaming applications.
Alternatively, video contents can be efficiently distributed on services offered by managed network architectures and CDN companies.
The major issues of CDN are high deployment cost and good but not unlimited scalability in the long term.  
Given the complementary features of P2P and CDN, in recent years some hybrid solutions have been proposed and applied to the operational of CDN \cite{Huang:2008:UHC:1496046.1496064,4772628,Yin:2009:DDH:1631272.1631279} to take the best of both approaches.
In Peer assisted CDN, users can download content from CDN nodes from or other users or peers. 
A user may cache the content after download to serve requests from other users. 
Due to the complexity of the behavior of peers, the process should be done in the home gateway user where the ISP can control it.

In this work, we will revisit Guo et al., \cite{1613869} work's PROP as basis to evaluate of the peer-assisted CDN and propose an improvement the model for the PROP.
Internet video on demand (VoD) is on rising todays e.g. Youtube.
We will take Youtube as an example of Internet VoD service model.
In Youtube service model, we can get data such as (1) the time when a video is uploaded and (2) number of access or number of view.
%The information of (1) the time when a video is uploaded and (2) number of access or number of view will be used for helping PROP.
In a seminal work, Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} use above information to estimate when a video become very popular.
Moreover, Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} classify a video popularity become three phases: before-peak phase, at-peak phase, and after-peak phase.
We will use estimation of a video popularity phases for helping PROP.
We will explain about video popularity in sect.\ref{popularity}.
%We also examine the characteristics of Internet VoD by investigating real-world datasets obtained from Youtube.
%We estimate the video popularity phase.
%Information of video popularity phase will be used for caching strategy
%In P2P assisted CDN for video on demand (VoD), most of researcher assume that catalog of video popularity rank is already established following zipf distribution.  
%This become basis for P2P assisted CDN model in PROP \cite{1613869}.
%Our work is quite different whereas we will use VoD view popularity to aid the PROP model.
%We use Youtube VoD view model for this purpose.
%In Youtube, video view popularity has three phase which is before-peak, at-peak, and after-peak \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} which we will explain later in sect.\ref{popularity}.
A twofold of our contributions as follows:
(1) We use the idea of VoD view popularity model to aid the PROP model. 
To our knowledge, the combination of PROP model and VoD view popularity model is the first.
(2) From simulation-based experiments, we find that peer contributions become higher than the PROP model.

Our paper presentation as follows: (1) we describe related work in sect.\ref{relatedwork}; (2) we explain detail of Youtube popularity evolution model in sect.\ref{popularity}; (3) we explain the caching strategy for CDN and peer in sect.\ref{systemdescription}; (4) we explain our simulation design, simulator, and its evaluation in sect.\ref{evaluation}.
Finally, we present our conclusions in section \ref{conclusion}.

\section{Related Work}\label{relatedwork}
Content Distribution Networks with peer assist have been successfully deployed on the Internet, such as Akamai \cite{Zhao:2013:PCD:2504730.2504752}, \cite{Huang:2008:UHC:1496046.1496064} and LiveSky \cite{Yin:2010:LEC:1823746.1823750}.  
The authors of \cite{Zhao:2013:PCD:2504730.2504752} examine the risks and benefits of peer-assisted content distribution in Akamai and measure the effectiveness of its peer-assisted approach. 
The authors of \cite{Huang:2008:UHC:1496046.1496064} conclude from two real world traces that hybrid CDN-P2P can significantly reduce the cost of content distribution and can scale to cope with the exponential growth of Internet video content.  
Yin et al. \cite{Yin:2010:LEC:1823746.1823750} described commercial operation of a peer-assisted CDN in China.  
LiveSky solved several challenges in the system design, such as dynamic resource scaling of P2P, low startup latency, ease of P2P integration with the existing CDN infrastructure, and network friendliness and upload fairness in the P2P operation.  
Xu et al.\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-4915} used game-theory to show the right cooperative profit distribution of P2P can help the ISP to maximize the utility.  
Their model can easily be implemented in the context of current Internet economic settlements.  
Misra et al.\cite{Misra:2010:IPS:1811099.1811064} also mentioned the importance of P2P architecture to support content delivery networks.
The authors use cooperative game theory to formulate simple compensation rules for users who run P2P to support content delivery networks.

The idea of telco- or ISP-managed CDN has been proposed in recent years.  
The complexity of the CDN business encourages telcos and ISPs to manage their own CDN, rather than allow others to run CDNs on their networks.  
It has been shown that it is cost effective \cite{federation}\cite{norton2011internet}. 
Kamiyama et al. \cite{NoriakiKAMIYAMA2013} proposed optimally ISP operated CDN.
Kamiyama et al. mentioned that, in order to deliver large and rich Internet content to users, ISPs need to put their CDNs in data centers.  
The locations are limited while the storage is large, making this solution effective; using optimum placement algorithm based on real ISP network topologies.  
The authors found that inserting a CDN into an ISP's ladder-type network is effective in reducing the hop count, thus reduce total link cost.  
Based on the author definition: Ladder-type network is a network with a maximum degree under $10$.
Cisco has initiated an effort to connect telco- or ISP-managed CDNs to each other, to form a CDN federation \cite{federation} using open standards \cite{cdni}.  
They argue that the current CDN architecture is not close enough to the users and ISPs can fill this position.

The idea of utilizing the user's computation power to support ISP operation is not new.  
The Figaro project \cite{figaro} proposed the residential gateway as an integrator of different networks and services, becoming an Internet-wide distributed content management for a proposed future Internet architecture \cite{figaro}.  
Cha et al.,\cite{Cha:2008:NTP:1855641.1855646} performed trace analysis and found that an IPTV architecture powered by P2P can handle a much larger number of channels, with lower demand for infrastructure compared to IP multicast.  
Jiang et al. \cite{Jiang:2012:OMD:2413176.2413193} proposed scalable and adaptive content replication and request routing for CDN servers located in users' home gateways.  
Maki et al.,\cite{NaoyaMAKI2012} propose traffic engineering for peer-assisted CDN to control the behavior of clients, and present a solution for optimizing the selection of content files.
Mathieu et al., \cite{6249305} are using data gathered from France telecom network to calculate reduction of network load if customers are employed as peer-assisted content delivery.

Guo et al., \cite{1613869} work's PROP is closest with our work.
%because we use that work as comparison and we use author's utility function.
PROP uses local system (local counter) to calculate the segment popularity in peer-assisted proxy system. 
PROP uses popularity for proxy cache replacement strategy. 
In peer side, the author use utility function for cache replacement strategy.
A utility function assigns numerical value to outcomes, in such a way that outcomes with higher utility are always preferred of outcomes with lower utilities.
The utility function is also function from popularity.
While the authors successfully show that the results are very good, the peer-assisted system behavior over time is not explain because the author focus on properties such as proxy cache size variations and peer cache size variations.
The explanation of the optimal number of replicas is not also clear because unavailable information when the snapshot is taken.  
In our work, we complement Guo et al., \cite{1613869} work with VoD viewing popularity evolution model and describe the behavior of the peer-assisted CDN over the time.

\section{Characterizing Internet VoD Popularity}\label{popularity}
As we mentioned earlier, we will use Youtube service model as an example of Internet VoD.
The objective of estimating Internet VoD popularity phase is to get popularity state of a requested video whether a video is before-peak popularity phase or at peak popularity phase, or  after-peak popularity phase.
We use Youtube as an example of VoD service where we get Youtube content popularity datasets from Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717}.
The datasets consists the measurement of 29000 videos view count and the time when videos are uploaded during 36 weeks.
Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} classify three phases of a video popularity: before-peak, at-peak, and after-peak.
The authors define time-to-peak for a video as its age (time since upload) at which its weekly viewing rate is the highest during measurement (from the first week until end of measurement).
The time-to-peak distribution is shown in fig.\ref{fig:timetopeak}.
Figure \ref{fig:timetopeak} shows Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} work that around three-quarters of a large fraction videos peak within the first six weeks since their upload and beyond six weeks we have uniform distribution thus the time-to-peak is exponentially distributed mixture with uniform distribution. 
To estimate the rate parameter of exponential part of time-to-peak distribution, we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) \cite{clauset2009power}.
Using MLE method, we can get exponential parameter $\lambda = 0.59$.
Because we know the peak time (at-peak phase) of every video, we can also know before-peak phase and after-phase of every video. 
For detail we refer the readers to \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717}.

%To estimate the the rate parameter of exponential part of time-to-peak distribution, we use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) \cite{clauset2009power}.
%Using MLE method, we can get exponential parameter $\lambda = 0.59$.
%For weekly views distribution, Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} found that beta distribution is a good model to explain video views popularity evolution thus we follow Borghol et al., \cite{Borghol:2011:CMP:2039452.2039717} for  weekly views distribution model.\\
To reveal data distribution of view rate for every video, we plot view rate versus week where we shift week of view rate of at-peak phase to zero. 
Therefore we can get view rate distribution relative to at-peak week as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:viewratedistribution}

% \end{figure} 

%We use estimation of video popularity phase in peer caching strategy side.
How we estimate the video popularity phase is shown in fig.\ref{fig:transformand2d}.
In fig.~\ref{fig:viewratedistexample} we have view rate (y-axis) and relative week to peak (x-axis) which is view rate distribution versus week relative to at-peak phase.
We transform these numbers by adding week number and make it as x-axis, view rate 
as y-axis, and relative week to peak as z-axis fig.~\ref{fig:viewratedistexample}.
This transformation is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:viewratedistexamplered} denote as box points.
Assume there is a peer requests a video, we want to estimate what is the phase of that video. 
Is the video in at-peak phase, before-phase, or after phase.  
We can estimate that video phase by averaging relative week to peak numbers (the points at z-axis) of the nearest point from datasets. 
If the average value less than $0$ we estimate the video is at before-peak phase, if the average value equal to $0$ we estimate the video is at at-peak phase,  and if the average value more than $0$ we estimate the video is at after-peak phase.

For example: there is a peer that requests a video where the position of video is in fourth week with the last week view rate $vr=2$ (we can get as this data from CDN) shown in fig.~\ref{fig:viewratedistexamplered} denote as circle.
In this case, the nearest points are the point at third week $(2,1,-1)$ and the point at fifth week $(4,1,1)$.  
By averaging the points at z-axis of the nearest points $(-1 + 1)/2 = 0$,  we can estimate that video is in at-peak phase.


\section{System Description}\label{systemdescription}
In our work, we use Youtube VoD view model to aid our work that based from PROP. 
The Youtube VoD view model will be used in peer-caching strategy side to exploits the video popularity while caching strategy in CDN side is out of scope. 

%\subsection{Peer caching strategy}\label{peercachingstrategy}
Since we can estimate before-peak phase, at-peak phase, and after-peak phase of video, we modified the original utility function from PROP by adding a $z(t)$ factor as follows:
\begin{equation}
u = \frac{ (f(p) - f(p_{min})) (f(p_{max}) - f(p)) }{r^{\alpha + \beta}} + z(t)
\end{equation}

$\frac{ (f(p) - f(p_{min})) (f(p_{max}) - f(p)) }{r^{\alpha + \beta}}$ is the utility function from PROP and $z(t)$ is the z factor from our model.
$z(t)$ is a function from current time in simulation.


\[
 z(t) =
  \begin{cases}
   0.15 & \text{if phase estimation is before-peak} \\
   0.47 & \text{if phase estimation is at-peak} \\
   0.38 & \text{if phase estimation is after-peak}
  \end{cases}
\]

Following \cite{1613869}, we can calculate $p$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
p = min \left(\frac{n_i^r}{t_i^r - t_a^i}  , \frac{1}{t_{cur} - t_i^r}\right)
\end{equation}

Where $n_i^r$ is number of requested video, $t_i^r$ is last time the video is requested, $t_a^i$ is the uploaded time of the video, and $t_{cur}$ is the current time.
$z(t)$ is proportion of view count that we get from Youtube datasets.  
To able to track the simulation, we use default value from PROP thus we refer the readers to \cite{1613869}.
%$p$ represents popularity of the video, $p_{min}$ represents estimation of minimum popularity in P2P system, $p_{max}$ represents estimation of maximum popularity in P2P system, $r$ represents the number of replicas of the video in the system, and $f(p)$ is monotonic non-decreasing function.
%$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the adjustment factor.
%The CDN can calculate $p_{min}$ and $p_{max}$ then propagate to the P2P system.
%To able to track the simulation, we use default value from PROP for $\alpha=\beta=1$ and $f(p)=log (p)$.
We choose the video with the smallest $u$ value as the candidate to be replaced when a peer's cache capacity is full.
In PROP's utility function, the difference between very popular videos and unpopular video is very difficult to differentiate. 
For unpopular video $f(p)$ will be very close to $f(p_{min})$ thus $f(p) - f(p_{min})$ will be very close to $0$ then utility function become very small.
For very popular video $f(p)$ will be very close to $f(p_{max})$ thus $f(p_{max}) - f(p)$ will be very close to $0$ then utility function become very small.  
Linear addition of $z(t)$ factor can help to differentiate the value of utility function.

\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}
%apa yng dievaluasi.
%bandingkan 2 proposal ini dng 2 metric yng ada misalnya.
%kenapa 2 metric ini dipilih.
%bagaimana evaluasinya:  bikin simulator: a, b, c ,d 

In order to evaluate the proposed peer-caching strategy using estimation of before-peak, at-peak, and after-peak information from Youtube VoD view model, we have to compare our model to PROP model.
We evaluate three metrics, which are peer contribution to delivery contents during simulation,  access frequency of cache during simulation, and number of replicas. 
Peer contribution metric related to byte-hit-ratio. 
Byte-hit-ratio is defined as the total bytes contents served by peers normalized by the total bytes of video all peers and CDN consume.
It means more peer contributions, more byte-hit-ratio because peer can get content from another peers. 
Access frequency of cache reflects the storage utilization. 
More access means more peer storage utilization.  
Number of replicas is also related to peer storage utilization.  
However, too many replicas will waste the storage resources.
To evaluate these metrics, we developed a peer-assisted CDN simulator. 


\subsection{Simulation Design}\label{simulationdesign}
An event driven simulator is developed using Python for this purpose.
In fig.\ref{fig:p2pcdninteractioninsimulator}, we describe the process of a peer that requests a video in simulator, which derived from PROP.
A peer and a CDN are implemented in object oriented-model inside the simulator. 
In short, a peer always requests to CDN then CDN will decided if a requested video is available in other peers or not. 
If a requested video is available in other peers, CDN will redirect the request to other peers.
If a requested video is not available CDN will serve the request.
%When a peer requests a video, it always goes to a CDN server (step 1). 
%The CDN provides the videos to the peer (step 2). 
%If there is another peer request same video, that request will go to CDN (step 3).  
%A CDN will check its record to see if there are some peers cache that requested video.  
%If there are some peers cache that requested video, a CDN will reply with redirect message that asking a peer to download requested video from other peer (step 4).
%If there are no peers have requested video, a CDN will serve the video.   
%A peer then can request the video to other peer and get the video (step 5 and step 6).
%From above description, we can see that deploying peer-assisted CDN can save some traffic since the clients which form P2P network can sharing the contents or videos.


\subsubsection{Catalog Generator}\label{catalog}
The goal for catalog generator is to create a catalog video that consist video-id, time when a video is uploaded, a video size, view count terminus, and progress of videos popularity like Youtube service model. 
We assume that a video is uploaded to server following Poisson process with mean rate $\lambda=1$ thus we can get the time when a video is uploaded. 
The view count terminus for every video is assigned randomly uniform from Youtube datasets and video size for every video is assigned randomly uniform between 1 and 200MB. Finally, we have a catalog that consists of: video-id, time when a video is uploaded, view count terminus, and video size.

\subsubsection{Peer Request Generator}\label{peerrequest}
In catalog generator, we assume peer request a video to CDN following Poisson process with a mean rate $\lambda=1$ \cite{Zink:2009:CYN:1502814.1502987}.
There are three scenarios for peer request:
First, a peer chooses a video that has popularity following Youtube.
The objective of the first scenario, we want to see the peer requests effect to peer-assisted CDN when the request following Youtube popularity. 
Second, a peer chooses a video that has popularity following Youtube but we shift the request four weeks later.  
The objective of the second scenario, we want to see the peer requests effect to peer-assisted CDN when the request from peers are lag four weeks after popular in Youtube.
Third, a peer chooses a video that has popularity following zipf distribution with rate$=0.9$ \cite{6654887} thus a peer choose a video that its popularity does not follow Youtube popularity.
The objective of the third scenario, we want to see the peer request effect to peer-assisted CDN when the requests from peers are totally different from Youtube's videos popularity.

%We assume that a peer choose a video based on a preference from view count and view rate that we can get from catalog generator.  
%Because peer requests are generate from catalog, the video request will follow global popularity video from YouTube


\subsubsection{Simulation Parameters and Scenarios}
The simulation parameters are follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Length: $360$ days.
\item Video size: uniform random between $1$MB and $200$MB.
\item Peer capacity: $500$MB.
\item CDN capacity: $10000$MB.
\item Number of peers: $100000$.
\item Number of videos: $10000$.
\end{itemize}
Finally, we compare our results to original PROP \cite{1613869} implementation.

%There are three scenarios in our simulations.
%First, peers choose a video that has a popularity following from Youtube data sets that we already explained in \ref{catalog}.
%Second, peers choose a video that has a popularity following from Youtube data sets and we shift the requests time four weeks.
%Third, peers choose a video that has a popularity following zipf distribution with rate$=0.9$ \cite{6654887}.
%We compare our results to original PROP \cite{1613869} implementation.

\subsection{Result and Discussion}\label{resultanddiscussion}
Figure \ref{fig:contribu-normal}, \ref{fig:contribu-shift}, and \ref{fig:contribu-zipf} show the absolute peer contribution to deliver videos compared between model and prop. 
Figure \ref{fig:contribu-normal} and fig.\ref{fig:contribu-shift} show same pattern.
The peers give more contribution in the tail while in the third scenario the peer contribution is mostly same between model and PROP. 
A peers can give more contribution because a video has longer duration than other videos in a peer's cache thus other peer's requests are served by the peer. 
A video has longer duration than other videos in peer's cache because that a video has bigger utility function than other videos for example a video that will enter the cache.

Figure \ref{fig:atd-normal}, \ref{fig:atd-shift}, and \ref{fig:atd-normal} show the number of  videos replicas available in system when a peer requests a video.
As we can see from all figures, the model gives us lower number of replicas than PROP.
The model gives lower number of replicas than PROP because when a peer requests a video, that peer is not cached the video.
We can see the proportion of cached and not-cached event in table.\ref{tab:stacked1}. 
We also present detail of the video phase breakdown in table.\ref{tab:stacked2}.
In model, not-cached events take around $65\%$ from all events and majority of video phase is  after-peak for both cached events and not-cached events. 
Because the majority of video phase is  after-peak for both cached events and not-cached events, 
In PROP, cached events take around $52\%$ from all events for the first scenario and the second scenario, while for the third scenario is $67.7\%$.
In model not-cached events are bigger than PROP, means peers do not cached the videos thus we get lower replicas number than PROP.
%If we see eq.\ref{eq:dlms_3} and table.\ref{tab:stacked2}, we found that the majority of video phase is in after-peak for both cached events and not-cached events, then big probability that $z_{ms}$ and $z_{dl}$ are in the same phase which is after-peak phase.


Denote $u_{dl}$ is the minimum utility function for a video inside the cache and $u_{ms}$ is utility function for a video that will enter the cache,  $p_{dl}$ is the popularity for a video inside the cache and $p_{ms}$ is the popularity for a video that will enter the cache.
In order a requested video is cached by a peer, the utility function for $u_{dl}$ must be lower than the utility function for $u_{ms}$.

\begin{align}\label{eq:dlms_1}
u_{dl} < u_{ms}
\end{align}

\begin{multline}\label{eq:dlms_2}
\frac{ (f(p_{dl}) - f(p_{min})) (f(p_{max}) - f(p_{dl})) }{r^{\alpha + \beta}_{dl}} + z_{dl} < \\
\frac{ (f(p_{ms}) - f(p_{min})) (f(p_{max}) - f(p_{ms})) }{r^{\alpha + \beta}_{ms}} + z_{ms}
%\end{equation}
\end{multline}

We assume that numbers of replicas are same, thus:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:dlms_3}
(f(p_{dl}) - f(p_{min})) (f(p_{max}) - f(p_{dl})) - \\ 
(f(p_{ms}) - f(p_{min})) (f(p_{max}) - f(p_{ms})) < \\
z_{ms} - z_{dl}
\end{multline}

Since $p_{min}$ and $p_{max}$ are same for $u_{dl}$ and $u_{ms}$, we can arrange the equation become:
\begin{align}\label{eq:dlms_4}
f(p_{ms}) - f(p_{dl}) > z_{dl} - z_{ms}
\end{align}

%comparing with PROP, we can get: 
%\begin{align}\label{eq:dlms_5}
%f(p_{ms}) - f(p_{dl}) > 0 \\
%f(p_{ms}) - f(p_{dl}) > z_{dl} - z_{ms}
%\end{align}

As we know from table.\ref{tab:stacked2} that the majority of a requested video is after-peak phase and a requested video phase that is  at-peak phase is very small portion, then we can see that $z_{dl} - z_{ms}$ term will be in negative term if $z_{dl}$ is  before-peak phase or $0$ if $z_{dl}$ is  after-peak phase. 
If $z_{dl} - z_{ms}=0$ then it is same with PROP. 
Since the not-cached events happen when a requested video phase is after-peak phase, we can get that $f(p_{ms}) - f(p_{dl} < 0$.
For the same situation and we compare to the PROP, the probability of $u_{ms}$ less than $u_{dl}$ in the model is higher than PROP. 
Therefore, we can see in the model that the events when a peer does not cache a video are more often than PROP.

%It also means that $p_{ms}$ in after-peak phase less popular than $p_{dl}$.
%While comparing to PROP, the left term $f(p_{ms}) - f(p_{dl})$ will be equal to $0$ thus as result in our model a peer rejects the a requested video to be cached.

%If both videos are in the same phase (e.g before-peak, at-peak, or after-peak) then the difference between $p_{dl}$ and $p_{ms}$ is the only factor for utility function.
%However, if the videos are not in the same phase then the difference between $p_{dl}$ and $p_{ms}$ must always bigger than the difference between $z_{ms}$ and $z_{dl}$.
%There are two cases for the difference between $z_{ms}$ and $z_{dl}$.
%The first case is negative and the second case is positive.    
%The difference between $z_{ms}$ and $z_{dl}$ is positive when: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $z_{ms}$ is in at-peak period and $z_{dl}$ is in before-peak period.
%\item $z_{ms}$ is in at-peak period and $z_{dl}$ is in after-peak period.
%\item $z_{ms}$ is in after-peak period and $z_{dl}$ is in before-peak period.
%\end{itemize}
%When the difference between $z_{ms}$ and $z_{dl}$ is negative, the difference between $p_{dl}$ and $p_{ms}$ is the only factor for utility function.

Figure \ref{fig:freq-normal}, \ref{fig:freq-shift}, and \ref{fig:freq-zipf} show the frequency of a video stay in peers compared between model and PROP.
As all figure show the model has higher frequency than PROP to stay in peers except for the beginning rank of data where the model has same frequency with prop in first and second scenario. 
In the third scenario, in the beginning rank of data the model has lower frequency than PROP, then around rank 1000 the model has higher frequency than prop until the end of data. 
The frequency a video stay in a video can also be viewed in fig \ref{fig:duration-normal},  \ref{fig:duration-shift}, and \ref{fig:duration-zipf}, where in the model some videos have longer cache duration than PROP, while others have shorter cache duration than PROP.  
Thus, we can see the relationship between cache duration and frequency a video stays in peers. 

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{conclusion}
This paper presents a scheme for peer-to-peer network can help CDN to deliver the content over the Internet. 
We show that by introducing $z$ factor to utility function we can maintain same peer contribution while reducing number of replicas.
We found that there are no much different between the first scenario, the second scenario and the third scenario in peer contribution to deliver a video. 
We found that in the all scenarios, the model gives lower replicas than PROP. 
This is because in the model, we found that not-cached events are higher than cached events, more specifically, the probability of utility function a requested video in model is lower than PROP.
Therefore, in the model the numbers of available replicas are lower than PROP. 
We also did the significance test to the number of replicas using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on two samples and we find that for all scenarios the $p$-values are less than $1$\% thus the results are significant. 

Some areas of improvement that we have identified for future are:
The energy trade off this peer-assisted CDN architecture in order to know how much energy saving by ISP and how much increase of energy at users home gateway side in this architecture since we have higher peer contribution.   
More numerical experiments for other zipf shape parameters.
